The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
We attempt to include **positive and negative results**, **pending tests**, and **total people tested for** each state or district currently reporting that data.
From here, you can also [learn about our methodology](https://covidtracking.com/about-tracker/), [see who makes this](https://covidtracking.com/about-team/), and [find out what information states provide and how we handle it](https://covidtracking.com/notes/).
