I first got into web design/development in the late 90s, and only as I type this sentence do I realize how long ago that was.
I’ve been taking for granted that *most* folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date.
Here’s a history of CSS and web design, as I remember it.
You may want to try the [W3C’s history of CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html), which is considerably shorter, has a better chance of matching reality, and contains significantly less swearing.)
My favorite artifact of this era is the book that taught me HTML: O’Reilly’s [HTML: The Definitive Guide](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781565924925), published in several editions in the mid to late 90s.
I don’t have it any more and can’t readily find screenshots online, but here’s a page from HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide, which seems to be a revision (I’ll get to XHTML later) with much the same style.
Partly because this is a guidebook introducing concepts one at a time; partly because the book was printed in black and white; and partly, I’m sure, because it reflected the reality that coloring anything was a huge pain in the ass.
