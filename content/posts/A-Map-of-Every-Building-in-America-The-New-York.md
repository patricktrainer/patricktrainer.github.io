On this page you will find maps showing almost every building in the United States.
Every black speck on the map below is a building, reflecting the built legacy of the United States.
## History Made Apparent
The nation’s expansion shows itself: The clustered development of the original colonies flowed west, with scattered cities and towns linked, like beads on a string, by rivers, highways and railroads.
## Traces of Distant Culture
**South of New Orleans** This arrangement of buildings along a narrow spit of land on either side of a Louisiana bayou shows the imprint of the region’s history under France: “long lot” development, which stretched skinny holdings laterally away from important waterways.
## A City, by Design
**Washington, D.C.** Many cities evolve over time, but some are designed from scratch.
Unlike places such as the Flint area — with its carefully plotted grids — places like the landscape east of Lancaster, Pa., have a long history of organic settlement.
