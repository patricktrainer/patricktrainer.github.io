I've been watching the blog scene develop for a while, and it's impossible to not want to join in.For a start the name, as my colleague Mike Two puts it, "blog sounds like something I should pay a physician to remove".Beyond the name, however, there's the very ephemeral nature of blog postings.Short bursts of writing that might be interesting when they are read - but quickly age.And I do like the fact that blogs make it easy to see what's really changed recently - thanks to the hooks into RSS and aggregators.So I decided I wanted something that was a cross between a wiki and a blog - which Ward Cunningham immediately dubbed a bliki.Like a blog, it allows me to post short thoughts when I have them.
