We’ve already covered that technical interviews are often primarily [about not being too weird](https://codeformore.com/can-you-pretend-to-be-normal-for-up-to-two-hours/) and that you should really try and [show your working](https://codeformore.com/technical-interviews-show-working/) when solving programming questions in interviews.
When you’re being asked technical questions, the point is not seeing whether or not you know the right answer — the point is to get you to show off your technical skills.
Here’s a plausible answer:
“I’ve used MySQL for three years, I’ve used PostgreSQL, and I have used SQLite for testing”
An answer that’s short and to the point.
But most technical questions in an interview are simply exploratory, and exist solely to get you to try to show off your technical experience.
And when you’re talking about technical problems you’ve solved in the past, or talking directly from your experience, you’re showing off your technical experience.
When you stop talking, you’ll get asked another question designed to show off your technical experience, and perhaps it’ll be on a topic you’re not so comfortable on.
If your monologuing about your experiences is boring them, or there’s something specific they want to talk about, they’ll cut you off and talk about it, but otherwise, keep segueing into other things you think they’d like to hear about, and that you’re good at talking about.
