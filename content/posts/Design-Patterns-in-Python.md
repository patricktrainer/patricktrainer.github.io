### Introduction
Design Patterns are reusable models for solving known and common problems in software architecture.A good presentation of a design pattern should include:
- Name
- Motivating problem
- Solution
- Consequences
### Equivalent Problems
If you were thinking that that's a pretty [fuzzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) concept, you'd be right.Patterns that could be applied to these sorts of problems are what we can meaningfully dub *design patterns*.### Design Patterns in Python
Traditionally, design patterns have been classified into three main categories: [Creational](https://stackabuse.com/design-patterns-in-python/), [Structural](https://stackabuse.com/design-patterns-in-python/), and [Behavioral](https://stackabuse.com/design-patterns-in-python/).There are also Python-specific design patterns that are created specifically around the problems that the structure of the language itself provides or that deal with problems in special ways that are only allowed because of the structure of the language.### Creational Design Patterns
