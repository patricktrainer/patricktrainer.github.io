Many strategy execution processes fail because the firm does not have something worth executing.
Many strategies fail to get implemented, despite the ample efforts of hard-working people, because they do not represent a set of clear choices.
** Another reason many implementation efforts fail is that executives see it as a pure top-down, two-step process: “The strategy is made; now we implement it.” That’s unlikely to work.
Stanford professor [Robert Burgelman said](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/strategy-destiny-how-strategy-making-shapes-companys-future), “Successful firms are characterized by maintaining bottom-up internal experimentation and selection processes while simultaneously maintaining top-driven strategic intent.” This is quite a mouthful, but what Burgelman meant is that you indeed need a clear, top-down strategic direction (such as Hornby’s set of choices).
Its top-down strategy was clear: (1) to be on the forefront of (2) semiconductor technology and (3) to be aimed at the memory business (not coincidentally a set of three clear choices!).
Identifying and countering the bad habits that keep your strategy from getting executed is not an easy process, but — as I elaborate on in my book *[Breaking Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Bad-Habits-Industry-Reinvigorate/dp/1633693821)* — there are various practices you can build into your organization to make it work.
For a successful strategy implementation process, however, it is useful to put the default the other way around: Change it unless it is crystal clear that the old way is substantially better.
