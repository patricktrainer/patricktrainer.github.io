Referral program
At Simple Analytics we do things a bit differently.
Traditional analytics tools will show you unique visits based on a cookie they place on the visitors computer.
## No consent needed
> With Simple Analytics you don’t need consent.
That’s why we came up with our unique way of tracking unique visits.

When a user lands on your website without visiting another website (direct visit) we will record it as a non unique visit:

## SPAs
If you have a single-page application we automatically see all visits after the first visit as non unique.
For the first visit we use above functionality to detect if a visit is unique.
