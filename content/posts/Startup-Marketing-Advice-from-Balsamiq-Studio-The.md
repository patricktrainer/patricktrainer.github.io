First off, the title of this post is a bit pretentious for my taste, but I wanted to pay homage to Mike Speiser's [excellent post on A/B testing using AdWords](http://www.conceptsl.com/veille/Entrepreneuriat/Startup%20Marketing%20Advice%20with%20AdWords.pdf), and take advantage of his $10.87 investment while I was at it!
Still, I can't deny that Balsamiq has received a very good amount of coverage in the blogosphere: I am timing this post to coincide with [the 100th review](http://kartones.net/blogs/kartones/archive/2008/08/04/review-balsamic-mockups.aspx) of Balsamiq Mockups (the full list is [here](http://delicious.com/tag/balsamiq_reviews?setcount=100&detail=3)), the website has received over 32,000 unique visitors and [sales are exceeding all my expectations](https://blog.balsamiq.com/10000-in-revenue-in-the-first-6-weeks/).
After reading [this article](http://marshallk.com/thoughts-on-product-launch-promotion) I decided to add [this section](https://balsamiq.com/company#forbloggers) to my company page and to tweak my "direct email template" (see below), and after reading [this one](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pitching_rww.php) I created an [OPML file](http://media.balsamiq.com/images/balsamiq_opml.xml) for Balsamiq's feeds, which in the end resulted in Marshall [covering Balsamiq on ReadWriteWeb himself](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/balsamiq_mockup_creator_is_on_fire.php).

If you are reading this and were on the receiving end of an email like this, forgive me for sending you a templated email...but I sent 40+ of these puppies and efficiency is a must for a one-man startup like mine!
I also have an RSS feed of a Twitter search for [prototyping OR "UI AND design" OR wireframe OR mockup OR UX](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+prototyping+OR+%22UI+OR+AND+OR+design%22+OR+wireframe+OR+mockup+OR+UX) which is a great read in general, and useful for finding people who are looking for a tool like mine: here's [an example](http://twitter.com/withfoam/statuses/870816307), and [here's another](http://twitter.com/burke_eric/statuses/865807180).
**Give to bloggers to give away**
Bloggers love to give away free stuff, as it makes their blog more popular.
All I do is select the person's name (from their email), copy it, paste it in the application, click "generate key", and what I get is not only the key, but a pre-populated email like this one:
*Hi there, here's your license info:*
*Download URL: http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups/desktop#download Organization name: test test Serial Key: [redacted]*
*I have some assets you can use here: http://www.balsamiq.com/company#forbloggers if you'd like.
