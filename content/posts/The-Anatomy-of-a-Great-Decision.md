*Making better decisions is one of the best skills we can develop.
In 1947, Secretary of State General George Marshall put forward a plan that has since carried his name, a plan to give a massive amount of money to several European nations.
From there came the principles, things like: strong economies minimize social unrest; countries that work toward mutual goals are less likely to fight each other; let’s not have another war in Europe anytime soon.
To invite Russia to partake
## **Using Multiple Lenses**
The decision to give rather than lend the majority of the aid was the result of looking at the situation through economic, political, and humanitarian lenses.
## Letting the World Do the Work For You
The decision to have the participating nations allocate the aid among themselves was the answer to what the historical, political and psychological lenses revealed.
Even though there was very little expectation that Russia would participate, and possibly even less desire to give them money, Russia and its allied countries were invited by both the US and the European nations to participate in the talks involving the implementation of the plan.
The Marshall Plan is remembered as a great decision, not strictly because of its outcomes—though it did contribute to the debatably successful reconstruction of Europe, it did not succeed in preventing the deterioration of relations with Russia—but because it was firmly grounded in principles that were identified and executed through a multidisciplinary lens.
