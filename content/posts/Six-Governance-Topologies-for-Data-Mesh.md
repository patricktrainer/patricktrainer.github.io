Piethein Strengholt, author of *Data Management at Scale*, recently published an article presenting [six data-mesh governance topologies and domain granularity](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-mesh-topologies-and-domain-granularity-65290a4ebb90).
Each topology adapts the data mesh strategy to balance requirements like data ownership, organization structure, pace of change, technology, and others.
Data mesh is an enterprise data architecture that adapts and applies the learnings in building distributed architectures to the domain of data.
Data mesh recommends creating self-serve data infrastructure, treating data as a product, and organizing teams and architecture based on business domains.
Organizations must adapt the data mesh concept to implement what works best for them today and use one of the following topologies as a starting point:
!
Organizations that value quality and compliance over agility can implement the fine-grained and fully governed mesh topology because it adds a central distribution layer to address distribution concerns.
However, organizations with hard-to-maintain legacy systems or lacking highly skilled software engineers can implement the "hybrid federated mesh" topology where federation happens on the consuming side domains and centralization in the others.
