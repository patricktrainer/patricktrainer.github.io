Every engineer is also a writer.
This collection of courses and learning resources aims to improve your technical documentation.
You can also learn about the role of technical writers at Google.

We've aimed these courses at people in the following roles:
- professional software engineers
- computer science students
- engineering-adjacent roles, such as product managers
You need at least a little writing proficiency in English, but you don't need to be a strong writer to take these courses.
These courses focus on technical writing, not on general English writing or business writing.
