*One of the oldest designs for a dining table is also one of the most highly engineered and contemporary.
Still, despite their spare charm and long history, there are some things about the dimensions of trestle tables that don’t conform to our typical expectations for tables.

And the trestle form frequently looks quite fragile, which seems at odds with the fact that these tables are typically the centerpiece of a casual dining area.
For many years, I’ve wanted to build a trestle table to replace the store-bought, white-pine apron table my wife and I got soon after college.
The pine apron table was a testament to everything I disliked about commercial furniture: The top was pieced together using narrow, knotty and poorly matched boards.

But if I hated our dining table, then I was equally afraid of the trestle table I wanted to build, which looked narrow, tippy and ready to collapse, so I put it off for 15 years.
Each end of a trestle table has a foot, leg and brace.
