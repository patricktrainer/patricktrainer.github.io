A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.
The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation.
It adopts a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.
Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference** and **explanation**.

Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these four types, and should keep them all separate and distinct from each other.

Diátaxis promises to make documentation and projects better, and the teams that work with them more successful.
Diátaxis is [proven in practice](https://diataxis.fr/adoption/#adoption) across a wide variety of fields and applications, in large and small, open and proprietary documentation projects.
