If the churn probability gets lower the longer the customer has been subscribed, you could model that as `c/(t+1)`, where `t` is the timestep (e.g. number of days the customer has been subscribed), and `c` is some constant.In this case, this implies that customer lifetimes comes from a [Lomax distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomax_distribution).Keep in mind, in each of the examples below we simulate lifetimes from the same customer lifetime distribution, and this distribution **does not change** over time.Multiply this by what you make per customer per day, and you have your Customer Lifetime Value.The distributions will both have the same *median* customer lifetime, but one has a larger *mean* lifetime than the other.Keep in mind that the *typical customers* (found by the median) stick around equally long in either company, but itâ€™s the rare long term customers that shift the Lifetime Customer Value massively in favor of the orange company.](http://fooledbyrandomness.com/DarwinCollege.pdf) So if you have Pareto 80/20 distributed customer lifetimes, **you need 100 billion customers before the sample mean lifetime is accurate.
