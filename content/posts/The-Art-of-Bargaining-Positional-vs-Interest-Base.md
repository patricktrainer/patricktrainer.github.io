We’ll cover the types of negotiation, and how to utilize them, specifically Positional vs Interest-Based Negotiation approaches.
**
A “successful” negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator is able to obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.
## **Part 1: Positional Bargaining**
Positional bargaining is a negotiation strategy that involves holding on to a fixed idea, or position, of what you want, and arguing for it and it alone, regardless of any underlying interests.
Therefore, positional bargaining is often considered a less constructive and less efficient strategy for negotiation than integrative negotiation.
## **Part 2: Interest-based bargaining**
### The win/win negotiator’s approach or Interest-Based Bargaining
Integrative bargaining (also called “interest-based bargaining,” “win-win bargaining”) is a negotiation strategy in which parties collaborate to find a “win-win” solution to their dispute.
Therefore, it is necessary when negotiating to convince the opposite party that they are getting a better deal than they really are, a person with low self-esteem will tend to push negotiations too far and to allow his own ego to dictate the course of negotiations.
