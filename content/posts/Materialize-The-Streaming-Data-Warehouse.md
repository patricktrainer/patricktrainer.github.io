## Building streaming data architecture can be as simple as writing SQL.
Materialize easily processes complex analytics over streaming datasets – offering the power and flexibility of a SQL data warehouse for the world of real-time data.

Materialize is the only technology that can enable engineers to completely develop for streaming data in a powerful declarative language – PostgreSQL – instead of building microservices.

Materialize is the first and only streaming system capable of running the TPC-H decision support benchmark – a set of criteria originally developed for the world of batch data warehouses.
With Materialize, data engineering teams can move away from the endless development of microservices – and replace thousands of lines of Java with a few lines of SQL.
