Whether you’re new to code or an experienced developer, simply pick a starter app to remix.

Glitch is a collaborative programming environment that lives in your browser and deploys code as you type.
Use Glitch to build anything from a good ol’ static webpage to full-stack Node apps.

You never have to start from scratch: Just start remixing an existing starter app, or [clone a project from services like GitHub and GitLab](https://glitch.com/help/kb/article/20-can-i-import-code-from-a-github-repository/) to experiment and deploy on Glitch.
Your favorite companies use Glitch to share apps that get you up and running with their APIs.
Anyone with a browser can jump in and pick up where you left off, and private .env files keep secrets like API keys, well, secret.

## Your app is live, instantly
There's no deployment setup—as soon as you create a new project, your Glitch app is live with its own URL (or your custom domain!).
