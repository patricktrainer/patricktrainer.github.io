            # How-to-Beat-Procrastination-Wait-But-Why

Let’s begin by trying to unwrap the procrastinator’s psychology and see what’s really at the core of things:
We know about the Instant Gratification Monkey (the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate) and his dominion over the Rational Decision Maker, but what’s really happening there?The Critical Entrance is where you go to officially start work on the task, the Dark Woods are the process of actually doing the work, and once you finish, you’re rewarded by ending up in The Happy Playground—a place where you feel satisfaction and where leisure time is pleasant and rewarding because you got something hard done.[How%20to%20Beat%20Procrastination%20%E2%80%94%20Wait%20But%20Why%205e80a1d1ef8b4588a51618f3f4eafd4c/darkwoodspro2.png](How%20to%20Beat%20Procrastination%20%E2%80%94%20Wait%20But%20Why%205e80a1d1ef8b4588a51618f3f4eafd4c/darkwoodspro2.png)
Here’s a procrastinator who couldn’t bring himself to get started, even though a work deadline was approaching, and he spent hours in The Dark Playground, knowing the looming deadline was drawing near and he was only making his life harder by not starting.To make things harder, the Dark Woods is surrounded by the Dark Playground, one of the monkey’s favorite places, and since he can see how close it is, he’ll try as hard as he can to leave the Dark Woods.[How%20to%20Beat%20Procrastination%20%E2%80%94%20Wait%20But%20Why%205e80a1d1ef8b4588a51618f3f4eafd4c/flow.png](How%20to%20Beat%20Procrastination%20%E2%80%94%20Wait%20But%20Why%205e80a1d1ef8b4588a51618f3f4eafd4c/flow.png)
Fighting through to the Tipping Point is hard, but what makes procrastination so hard to beat is that the Instant Gratification Monkey has a terribly short-term memory—even if you wildly succeed on Monday, when you begin a task on Tuesday, the monkey has forgotten everything and will again resist entering the Dark Woods or working through them.Laying each brick yields an inner struggle—and in the end, your ability to win this very specific struggle and lay brick after brick, day after day, is what lies at the core of a procrastinator’s struggle to gain control over his world.Part of the reason I assigned terms to so many of these feelings or phenomena—the Instant Gratification Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, the Panic Monster, the Dark Playground, Ickiness, Bricks, the Critical Entrance, the Dark Woods, the Tipping Point, the Happy Playground, Flow, your Storyline—is that terms help you clarify the reality of the choices you’re making.
