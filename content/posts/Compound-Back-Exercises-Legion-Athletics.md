These are kinds of free weight back exercises that give you a full back workout in less time than other back exercises, and allow you to lift heavier weights more safely.T-Bar Row](https://legionathletics.com/best-back-exercises/)
- [An Example Back Workout](https://legionathletics.com/best-back-exercises/)
There are several muscles that make up the bulk of the back:
- Trapezius (traps)
- Rhomboids
- Teres major and minor
- Infraspinatus
- Latissimus dorsi (lats)
- Erector spinae (iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis muscles)
When people refer to the upper back or thoracic spine, they’re referring mainly to the [trapezius](https://legionathletics.com/trap-exercises/), [lats](https://legionathletics.com/lat-exercises/), rhomboids, teres muscles, and infraspinatus.By “heavy,” I mean doing back exercises with weights in the range of 75 to 85% of your [one-rep max](https://legionathletics.com/tools/1rm-calculator/) (1RM), or in the range of 8 to 10 (~75%) to 4 to 6 (~85%) reps.
You don’t have to do your full back workout in a low rep range—high-rep sets also have a place—but the majority of your time should be spent doing free weight back exercises with heavy weights.**Why:** The deadlift is hands down the best all-around back exercise you can do because it trains every muscle in your posterior chain (the muscles on the back side of your body).Push your hips back, arch your lower back slightly, keep your shoulders back and down, and make sure your head is in a neutral position.This taxes your back muscles slightly differently to other free weight back exercises.> Deadlift: 3 sets of 4 to 6 reps Barbell Row: 3 sets of 4 to 6 reps One-Arm Dumbbell Row: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps Pull-up or chin-up: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
