What was the specific mistake, what did you learn from it, and how did you change the way you do business as a result?
For example, I was told by someone who started a project without taking an advance, only for the client to decide not to pay.
So he now refuses to take on a project without at least 30% advance.
What lessons did you learn the hard way?
I'm setting up my own consulting practice: kartick.org and would like to learn from other people's mistakes rather than repeating them myself.
