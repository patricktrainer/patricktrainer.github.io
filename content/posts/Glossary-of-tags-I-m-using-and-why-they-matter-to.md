["Quantified self"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) refers to self tracking and coming up with metrics in order to gain more insight and potentially improve various aspects of your life such as health (physical or mental) or performance.

- **finding my baseline** while I'm healthy for potential future health issues
