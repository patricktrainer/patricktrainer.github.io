**Note:** Before beginning this tutorial, you will first need to host the Snowplow JavaScript tracker file `sp.js`.Before you integrate Snowplow's JavaScript Tracker, you need to decide whether you'll integrate it with a tag management system, or implement the Snowplow tags directly onto your site.We strongly advise new Snowplow users who are not using a Tag Management solution to implement one before implementing Snowplow, and integrate Snowplow using it.We have documented [how to setup Google Tag Manager](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-Javascript-tags-with-Google-Tag-Manager) and [how to setup QuBit's OpenTag](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-Javascript-tags-with-QuBit-OpenTag), as well as how to integrate Snowplow using both these solutions, as part of this setup guide.Select a setup option below based on your choice of Tag Management solution:
Once you have integrated tags on our site (either directly or via a tag manager) you should [test that the tags are firing correctly](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Testing-the-Javascript-tracker-is-firing).[Setting up campaign tracking](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/tracking-your-marketing-campaigns) (optional but recommended).Back to [Tracker Setup](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Setting-up-a-tracker).
