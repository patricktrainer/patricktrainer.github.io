> Burn out happens when - the company or team is under duress, imagine running a manufacturing software system and your factory lines are down.
But, that's not because of the reasons listed here.
I wouldn't say that's the case at all.
The first time I struggled with burnout was because the organisation I worked within was built in such a way that the rank and file are irrelevant and take some sort of grim pleasure in being low status.
In that situation there doesn't have to be any crisis or external pressure.
The further I get away from that, the happier I am.
IME the company, your life, whatever, can be falling apart as long as you know that those around you are actually playing the same game as you and care about the outcome.
