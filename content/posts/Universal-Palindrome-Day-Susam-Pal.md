There are three popular date formats followed worldwide: big-endian, little-endian, and middle-endian.Here is how today's date looks like in these three formats if the full year is written:
The ISO 8601 standard specifies the big-endian date format.The little-endian date format is popular in a huge number of countries including Germany, United Kingdom, India, Italy, etc.The middle-endian date format is primarily popular in the United States.Today's date is a palindrome in all three date formats.If we define *universal palindrome day* to be a day when its date is a palindrome in all three date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, and MM-DD-YYYY), then today is a universal palindrome day!Here is a list of all universal palindrome days between the years 1000 and 9999:
- `1010-01-01`
