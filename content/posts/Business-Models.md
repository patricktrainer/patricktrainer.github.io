Indeed.
Some of these models are partially-applied functions - they're missing the part that actually makes them money.
For instance:
> Network effects (can come in different forms such as direct, two-sided, data): Facebook — the value of the product increases as more people use it
Network effects keeps the users in, money is made by ads and surveillance.
> Crowdsourcing: YouTube — aggregate content/product from users individuals and distributes them at scale
Really, it's also a form of network effects (viewers go where most content is; creators go where most viewers are), and again, money is made by ads and surveillance.
Also, missing models:
- Regulatory arbitrage: Uber - conquering markets by breaking local laws faster than the regulators can react.
Also2:
> Open-source: Bitcoin
Bitcoin is not a company and does not have a business model.
"Donations" and "Paid support" are.
