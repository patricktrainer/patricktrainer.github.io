We've prepared the following lists of recommended native plants that are highly attractive to pollinators such as native bees, honey bees, butterflies, moths, and hummingbirds, and are well-suited for small-scale plantings in gardens, on business and school campuses, in urban greenspaces, and in farm field borders.
These lists are not intended to be exhaustive, but reflect a "best-of" approach identifying plants known from various trials and research efforts to provide a number of benefits to a diversity of pollinators, are regionally appropriate, and highly adaptable to a range of growing conditions.
For more plant suggestions, see all [Plant Lists in our Publications Library](https://xerces.org/publications?field_publication_type_target_id=38&field_state_target_id=All&field_keywords_target_id=All&field_program_target_id=All), or check out our books *[100 Plants to Feed the Bees](https://xerces.org/books/100-plants-feed-bees)* and *[Gardening for Butterflies](https://xerces.org/books/gardening-butterflies)*.
Use our [Pollinator Conservation Resource Center](https://xerces.org/pollinator-resource-center) for everything from plant lists to habitat establishment guides.
