The **interesting number paradox** is a semi-humorous [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) which arises from the attempt to classify every [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) as either "interesting" or "uninteresting".
The "[proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof)" is [by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction): if there exists a non-empty set of uninteresting natural numbers, there would be a smallest uninteresting number – but the smallest uninteresting number is itself interesting because it is the smallest uninteresting number, thus producing a [contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction).
In a discussion between the mathematicians [G. H. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy) and [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) about interesting and uninteresting numbers, Hardy remarked that the number [1729](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)) of the taxicab he had ridden seemed "rather a dull one", and Ramanujan immediately answered that it is interesting, being the smallest number that is the [sum of two cubes in two different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number).
## Paradoxical nature[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interesting_number_paradox&action=edit&section=1)]
Attempting to classify all numbers this way leads to a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) or an [antinomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomy) of definition.
[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) The number fitting this definition later became 12407 from November 2009 until at least November 2011, then 13794 as of April 2012, until it appeared in sequence [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences): [A218631](https://oeis.org/A218631) as of 3 November 2012.

The mathematician and philosopher [Alex Bellos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bellos) suggested in 2014 that a candidate for the lowest uninteresting number would be [247](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247_(number)) because it was, at the time, "the lowest number not to have its own page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia)".
