### Nursing: Watch out for too much of a good thing
It may seem really obvious, but kitten carers often think that if a kitten is constantly nursing from the queen, all must be well.

### Kitten reflexes
Absence or weakness of these basic reflexes, necessary for survival, are indicators of serious trouble.
The kitten should suckle automatically
### Drug dosing in neonates
Liver and kidney function are immature up to 6 weeks of age, so drug metabolism is impaired.
### Crashing kittens
Critically ill kittens typically have hypothermia, hypoglycemia and/or dehydration.
Only give oral fluids or dextrose after the kitten has been warmed.
### The colours of kittens (mucous membranes and stool, that is)
Mucous membranes:
- Hyperemia is normal for kittens < 7 days â€“ thereafter their mucous membranes should be pink and hyperemia in kittens > 7d can signal dehydration
- Sick kittens can be pale or cyanotic
- Septicemia is a common end result of many conditions.
Stool:
- Normal neonate stool is yellow or tan colour, with a toothpaste consistency
- Yellow/green watery stool is a sign of overfeeding
- Blood in the stool can indicate coccidiosis, sepsis, parvo, *E.coli* or *Salmonella* infections
### X-rays in kittens
Reduce KVP by 50% because the low fat percentage results in low contrast.
