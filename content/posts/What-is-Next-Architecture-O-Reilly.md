            # What-is-Next-Architecture-O-Reilly

## We’re already there
Today, many organizations are already thinking and developing software in consonance with Next Architecture’s foundational priorities and principles, even if they are not consciously (or conscientiously) “doing” Next Architecture.Next Architecture is likewise premised on the understanding that software (and software architecture) is not merely a digital twin of your business—i.e., its virtual complement or mirror—but *is*, in an essential sense, your business.Let’s briefly consider a few of the specific business benefits of using the concepts, technologies, and practices of Next Architecture to build software:
- **Feature agility** — You can quickly develop features and add them to your digital presence.## Next Architecture challenges
While the [data](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/3-emerging-trends-tech-leaders-should-watch) shows many organizations directionally adopting Next Architecture, these organizations face challenges that span across training/hiring, culture, distributed data integrity, new cost regimes, migration, managing complexity, and decomposition.For organizations addressing the move from legacy monolith architectures, the migration to Next Architecture requires a close look at what makes sense, both from a technology and cost perspective, to cleave off as microservices that can be deployed in the cloud.Next Architecture harnesses containers, service orchestration (via Kubernetes, Swarm, or similar platforms) and other commodity technologies in what could nominally be described as a microservice architecture.Next Architecture’s overarching goals are two-fold: first, it aims to deliver an improved overall service experience for customers; second, it aims to produce software architecture that is more flexible and resilient—in other words, that has a capacity for adaptability.
