# I-almost-sold-Baremetrics-for-5m-Baremetrics***
In the past six years of Baremetrics’ existence, I’ve received dozens upon dozens of emails from folks interested in acquiring Baremetrics.
I’ve always sort of assumed that the sale of Baremetrics would one day mean I make a decent chunk of money, but now it was “Hey Josh, you could be a millionaire in a matter of weeks!”
## There’s always a price
I was still very torn on the idea.
Most people will tell you, especially when things are going well, that they’re not interested in selling their company.
During this time I was also having weekly calls with the buyer, checking in as they did their own research and (theoretically) had their lawyers looking over things while we did our work with diligence documents.
After that I went back to the drawing board to try and salvage all the work that’d been done with other interested buyers, but at the end of the day, none of the other offers (which were anywhere from $1m to $4.5m) made economic, logistical or cultural sense.
Once I realized we didn’t have any offers that I was happy with, I pouted for a day, then immediately jumped back in to running the company and planning out the future.
