## Calculate with numbers youâ€™re not sure about
Hi, I'm Filip, and I'd like to introduce to you an early version of an uncertainty calculator.
The *range* notation says the following to the calculator: *I am not sure about the exact number here, but I am 95% sure it's somewhere in this range.
*"Well, I don't know this number exactly, so I'll just pick the first number that seems plausible and calculate with that.

Unsure Calculator to the rescue!

## Other use cases
Here are some ideas of how to use this calculator and its notation.
For example: `1000~1500 x 10~12 x (30~50 / 100)`
- Estimate time saved by a dishwasher (or any other piece of technology) given uncertain number of times used per week, uncertain time saving per use, uncertain lifetime and uncertain installation costs.
For example: `100 x tan(70 ~ 80)`
- Estimate return on investment of a marketing campaign, given an uncertain number of views, uncertain click through rate, uncertain conversion rate, and uncertain spend.
