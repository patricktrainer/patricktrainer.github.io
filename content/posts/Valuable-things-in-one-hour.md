Taking this also as a bit of an Ask HN:
Easily the Tiny Habits habit formation regime created by Stanford researcher BJ Fogg.
Quite nefarious use of psychology for advertising/“engagement”, but the plus side is you can use the same strategies to build habits you want to build.
Step 1: Consider the habit you want to build, e.g. “I want to meditate 10 minutes every day”
Step 2: Make it the absolute smallest possible version of itself; so small that it requires zero motivation/willpower, e.g. “I want to close my eyes and take 3 deep breaths every day”
Step 3: Place this habit immediately following an existing habit, e.g. “After I brush my teeth in the morning, I will close my eyes and take 3 deep breaths”
Step 4: Do this activity, and after each time you do it, reward yourself with a small celebration.
I’ve used this method to pick up daily meditation, journaling, and flossing (acquired simultaneously!)
I spent a month of the year just flossing 1 tooth each night (ridiculous, I know!
* Part of the trick is finding a good habit to put your new habit after.
You probably already have a lot more habits than you know, since the whole point of a habit is to be automatic.
