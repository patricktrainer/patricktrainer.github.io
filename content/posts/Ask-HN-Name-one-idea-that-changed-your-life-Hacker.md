Nick Cave, on writer's block:
"My advice to you is to change your basic relationship to songwriting.You are not the ‘Great Creator’ of your songs, you are simply their servant, and the songs will come to you when you have adequately prepared yourself to receive them.They are not inside you, unable to get out; rather, they are outside of you, unable to get in."[https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-u-have-any-spare-lyrics/](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-u-have-any-spare-lyrics/)
