I’m in love with the idea that open source software has, and will continue to, change the world as we know it.
It’s amazing how much of the society we live in today is built on top of free resources that are accessible to the public.
It’s easy to take for granted, but when I try to explain the concept to a friend who knows nothing about the software world, it blows their mind.
But open source software grows at an overwhelming pace, and reading about a piece a software is not the same as trying it out.
Recently, I’ve been using to speed through testing out new pieces of software that I’d like to try, and since it’s worked nicely for me I thought it could help some people on here.
