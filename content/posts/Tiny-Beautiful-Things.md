She claimed she would offer a combination of “the by-the-book common sense of Dear Abby and the earnest spiritual cheesiness of Cary Tennis and the butt-pluggy irreverence of Dan Savage and the closeted Upper East Side nymphomania of Miss Manners.”
It became clear after a while that she was an advice columnist unlike others: intimate and frank, dispensing advice built on a foundation drawn of deep personal experience.In a way Sugar’s advice columns — combined into the amazing collection [Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949338/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0307949338&linkId=5129db7c78439c3887bd415b56cd5d69) — represents an ad hoc memoir.“But it’s a memoir with an agenda,” Strayed’s friend Steve Almond writes in the introduction, “With great patience, and eloquence, (Sugar) assures her readers that within the chaos of our shame and disappointment and rage there is meaning, and within that meaning is the possibility of rescue.”
> Inexplicable sorrows await all of us.The sort of people worthy of your love will love you more for this, sweet pea.Leaving doesn’t mean you’re incapable of real love or that you’ll never love anyone else again.One Christmas at the very beginning of your twenties when your mother gives you a warm coat that she saved for months to buy, don’t look at her skeptically after she tells you she thought the coat was perfect for you.Yours, Sugar
