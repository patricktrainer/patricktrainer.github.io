Diagram of the OODA loop
The **OODA loop** is the cycle observe–orient–decide–act, developed by [military strategist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy) and [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force) Colonel [John Boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)).
It is especially applicable to cyber security and cyberwarfare [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)
## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OODA_loop&action=edit&section=1)]
The OODA loop has become an important concept in [litigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litigation_strategy),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) business,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) [law enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) and [military strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy).
As one of Boyd's colleagues, Harry Hillaker, put it in "John Boyd, [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force) Retired, Father of the [F16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon)":
> The key is to obscure your intentions and make them unpredictable to your opponent while you simultaneously clarify his intentions.

The OODA loop also serves to explain the nature of surprise and shaping operations in a way that unifies [Gestalt psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology), [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) and [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) in a comprehensive theory of strategy.
