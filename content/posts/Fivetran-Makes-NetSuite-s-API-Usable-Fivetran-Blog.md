NetSuite is one of the premier providers of ERP software, billing itself as a cloud-based [replacement for](http://www.netsuite.com/portal/solutions.shtml) QuickBooks, Microsoft Dynamics GP, SAP and others.
The NetSuite connector is currently a major selling point for Fivetran, not only because of its general usefulness as a piece of software but also because of the complete and utter intractability of its API.
As the Fivetran team began to build the NetSuite connector using the standard SOAP API, we quickly realized that there was a three-way disconnect between the software’s UI elements, documentation, and data feed.
The Fivetran team is still continually tuning and optimizing the NetSuite connector.
The challenges the Fivetran team experienced while building the NetSuite connector have stymied company after company, turning the Fivetran NetSuite connector into a staple among our frustrated customers.
By purchasing the Fivetran NetSuite connector, you can have your cake and eat it, too — and obviate the frustration and false steps that would otherwise consume the attention of your engineers.
