# Your-guide-to-creating-a-website-wireframe-CacooThis guide is useful for:
- Anyone interested in learning more about UX design,
- UX Designers just starting their careers,
- UX Designers struggling to deliver quality wireframes, and
- UX design veterans wanting to brush up on the fundamentals and stay up-to-date on new trends.
Achieving this outcome requires an effective design process and a skilled UX Designer who understands how to create the right type of wireframe with the right design elements at the right time.
### Types of wireframes
People use many terms to describe wireframes, but essentially there are three types:
- Content wireframes,
- Annotated wireframes, and
- Interactive wireframes.
By removing any graphic design from these initial wireframes, the UX Designer can focus on what matters most: laying out content in a way that best achieves business goals and user needs while keeping elements consistent across different pages and devices.
### Interactive wireframes
Sometimes called prototypes, interactive wireframes require digital design tools that allow for the addition of interactivity into your wireframes to test with users.
Here are a few examples of common design processes
- Content Wireframe > Annotated Wireframe > Prototype > Code
- Content Wireframe > Annotated Wireframe > Lo-fi Wireframe > Prototype > Code
- Content Wireframe > Annotated Wireframe > Hi-fi Mockup > Prototype > Code
- Content Wireframe > Annotated Wireframe > Lo-fi Wireframe > Hi-fi Mockup > Prototype > Code
- Content Wireframe > Code
There are many common objects and symbols used within wireframing templates.
This will include:
**Interaction feedback**, i.e. information that tells the user what happened or what will happen next, such as:
- Validation responses for forms
- Intermediary messages and modals
**Interaction states**, i.e. potential states for all UI components, such as:
- Dropdown lists
- Titles, labels, and names
- Dynamic content
- Icons with numbers
- Form fields
- File uploads
**Gestures**, i.e. the way your users will physically interact with your UI on a given device, such as:
- Click
- Double-click
- Right-click
- Swipe or flick
- Pinch and spread
- Press
- Hover
- Drag and drop
- Keyboard input
- Keyboard shortcuts
**Cross-device interactions**, i.e. gestures that may not translate to different devices:
- Hovering
- Dragging and dropping
- Uploading files
**User types**, i.e. what different users see based on their previous interactions with the page, such as:
- New users
- Guests
- First-time visitors
- Returning visitors
- Existing or logged-in users
- Admins and super-users
As we stated earlier in this guide, UX and UI often overlap.
