# 2-How-VC-works-A-Beginner-s-Guide-Simplanatio

Venture capital is the investments of **private capital in private companies**, ie, companies not listed on the stock exchange.
They are ready to invest in a VC fund because of the high returns expected from it compared to other options they have (public equity markets, debt, real estate, etc).
- The first 2-3 years, Bala's effort goes into identifying and investing in startups
- The next 3-4 years go into building them
- The last 2-3 years is when Bala tries to 'exit' the investments and make money
5.
Bala can also show that he'll include
- **Clauses for voting rights** on key decisions like selling the company or when to IPO
- **Anti-dilution clauses** - if the startup raises the next round of funding at a lower valuation, the # of shares owned by the fund will be adjusted so that the fund continues to own the same % of the startup as before the round
6.
When you go through the list of portfolio companies on a VC's website, remember that they could be investments from different funds, each of which have different goals :)

# VC is f**king tough
With high risk comes high returns.

**Continuing Bala's example...**
Bala ended up raising $10M and invested that money in 25 companies.
To generate a 25% annualized return, Bala's fund has to at least 10x its original size, ie, the sum total of all the investments has to be at $100M (10x over 10 years = 25% year-on-year growth)
Now, this would have been simple if all the 25 startups grew 10x in those 4-5 years after Bala invested.
