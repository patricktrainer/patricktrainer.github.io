# Design-Thinking-101## History of Design Thinking
It is a common misconception that design thinking is new.
Cue design thinking, a formalized framework of applying the creative design process to traditional business problems.
## What — Definition of Design Thinking
Design thinking is an **ideology supported by an accompanying process**.
As Don Norman preaches, “we need more design doing.” Design thinking does not free you from the actual design doing.
There are numerous reasons to engage in design thinking, enough to merit a standalone article, but in summary, design thinking achieves **all** these advantages at the same time:
- It is a user-centered process that starts with user data, creates design artifacts that address real and not imaginary user needs, and then tests those artifacts with real users.
