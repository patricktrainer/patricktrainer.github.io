# Explorable-Explanations### Proposition 21: Vehicle License Fee for State Parks
The way it is now:
California has 278 state parks, including state beaches and historic parks.
An explanation requires an **author**, to interpret the results of the model, and present them to the reader via language and graphics.
Contextual Information
As much as we might wish authors to write explorable explanations, many won't.
And even authors with good intentions can't predict everything that the reader will want to explore.
How can active readers ask questions and question assumptions while **reading normal text?
Treating the author's text as a base layer for hosting the reader's own explorations.
** How do we make readers demand explorable explanations, and reject static text?
