Many of the most consequential projects of the internet era — from Wikipedia to Facebook and bitcoin — have all been predicated on [network effects](https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/), where the network becomes more valuable to users as more people use it.
## 1) Slow networks
**Slow networks are defined by a time delay between when the network is created and when it starts to show value**.

Like a slow network, an unfinished network will have bottled up network effects, but they won’t show up in any analysis or metrics.
## 2B) Throttled networks
**A throttled network is one where a product feature or strategic decision limits the size or engagement of the network in a material way**, thereby masking the strength of the network effects.
Like an unfinished network, a throttled network appears to have limited network effects — until all of a sudden, it doesn’t.
The test for telling whether it’s a throttled network with strong network effects is fairly straight-forward: understand what would happen if one of more of these constraints (e.g., price, network growth, engagement, etc.)
## 3) Latent networks: (aka “Come for the network, stay for the tool” networks)
There are a host of companies that build the tool or product before they build the network.
