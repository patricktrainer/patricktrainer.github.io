Notion itself does not provide this function yet, according to their twitter we might see it someday:
Luckily I have found this [gist](https://gist.github.com/mayneyao/b9fefc9625b76f70488e5d8c2a99315d) from [mayneyao](https://gist.github.com/mayneyao).
And this is why I decided to create a step by step guide on how to set up custom domains for Notion.
To follow this tutorial, you will need:
* Custom domain and access to the DNS settings * Page in Notion that should be your landing page * Account on [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
Letâ€™s start with the page itself.
For our use case, we will make use of the **Workers** feature that will forward incoming requests from users to the public Notion page that we have created earlier.
Modify them using your domain in *your domain* and public Notion page in *start page url*.
If everything went smoothly and the * Notion page is set to public * the nameservers on your domain provider were changed * CloufFlare successfully verified your domain
You should be able to see your public Notion page after entering your domain in the URL of your browser:
Each use-case is different.
