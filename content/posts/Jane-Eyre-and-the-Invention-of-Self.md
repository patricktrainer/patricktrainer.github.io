Consider the selfie.Perhaps the first novel to best express the modern idea of the self was *Jane Eyre*, written in 1847 by Charlotte Brontë, born 200 years ago this year.The broader cultural implications of the story—its insistence on the value of conscience and will—were such that [one critic fretted](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5vVFAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA557) some years after its publication that the “most alarming revolution of modern times has followed the invasion of *Jane Eyre*.” Before the Reformation and the Enlightenment that followed, before Rene Descartes’s *cogito ergo sum* (“I think, therefore I am”), when the sources of authority were external and objective, the aspects of the self so central to today’s understanding mattered little because they didn’t really affect the course of an individual’s life.“As we open *Jane Eyre* once more,” a doubting Woolf wrote in *[The Common Reader](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c/chapter14.html),* “we cannot stifle the suspicion that we shall find her world of imagination as antiquated, mid-Victorian, and out of date as the parsonage on the moor, a place only to be visited by the curious, only preserved by the pious.” Woolf continues, “So we open *Jane Eyre;* and in two pages every doubt is swept clean from our minds.” There is nothing of the book, Woolf declares, “except Jane Eyre.” Jane’s voice is the source of the power the book has to absorb the reader completely into her world.More disturbing to Brontë’s Victorian readers than the sheer sensuality of the story and Jane’s deep passion was “the heroine’s refusal to submit to her social destiny,” as the literary critic Sandra M. Gilbert [explains](https://books.google.com/books?id=3oxf7_BsD_sC&pg=PA338&lpg=PA338&dq=%E2%80%9Crefusal+to+accept+the+forms,+customs,+and+standards+of+society.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=w4-mW8TX3Y&sig=R70bhh8SEbjqS_mE-caoc-FaPI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN3J71keHKAhWFHx4KHZ7BCgYQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9Crefusal%20to%20accept%20the%20forms%2C%20customs%2C%20and%20standards%20of%20society.%E2%80%9D&f=false).Indeed, one [contemporary review](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TPc9AAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA68) complained, “It is true Jane does right, and exerts great moral strength,” but the critic continues that “it is the strength of a mere heathen mind which is a law unto itself.” In presenting such a character, the reviewer worries, Brontë has “overthrown authority” and cultivated “rebellion.” And in a way they were right: “I resisted all the way,” Jane says as she is dragged by her cruel aunt toward banishment in the bedroom where her late uncle died.>
In a [letter](https://books.google.com/books?id=ESH22a2yaWoC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Unless+I+have+the+courage+to+use+the+language+of+Truth+in+preference+to+the+jargon+of+Conventionality,+I+ought+to+be+silent+%E2%80%A6.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=Qh_xHA_GrR&sig=b_HT0kFcgyC1YvH_pgHLp5Q_I6I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt47WCj-HKAhUBeT4KHctWASoQ6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&q=Unless%20I%20have%20the%20courage%20to%20use%20the%20language%20of%20Truth%20in%20preference%20to%20the%20jargon%20of%20Conventionality%2C%20I%20ought%20to%20be%20silent%20%E2%80%A6.%E2%80%9D&f=false) to a friend, Bronte responded to her critics’ objections by declaring, “Unless I have the courage to use the language of Truth in preference to the jargon of Conventionality, I ought to be silent ...”
The refusal of such a woman, who lived in such a time, to be silent created a new mold for the self—one apparent not only in today’s Instagram photos, but also more importantly in the collective modern sense that a person’s inner life can allow her to effect change from the inside out.
