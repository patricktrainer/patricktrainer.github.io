The **odds-algorithm** is a mathematical method for computing optimal strategies for a class of problems that belong to the domain of [optimal stopping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping) problems.
Formally, the objective in these problems is to maximize the probability of identifying in a sequence of sequentially observed independent events the last event satisfying a specific criterion (a "specific event").
At the same time it computes
The output is
The odds-strategy is the rule to observe the events one after the other and to stop on the first interesting event from index s onwards (if any), where s is the stopping threshold of output a.
Applications reach from medical questions in [clinical trials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial) over sales problems, [secretary problems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problems), [portfolio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)) selection, (one-way) search strategies, trajectory problems and the [parking problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_problem) to problems in on-line maintenance and others.
[Matsui & Ano 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_algorithm) discussed a problem of selecting out of the last successes and obtained a tight lower bound of win probability.
A problem discussed by [Tamaki 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_algorithm) is obtained by setting
**multiple choice problem**: A player is allowed choices, and he wins if any choice is the last success.
When , [Ano, Kakinuma & Miyoshi 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_algorithm) showed that the tight lower bound of win probability is equal to For general positive integer , [Matsui & Ano 2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_algorithm) discussed the tight lower bound of win probability.
